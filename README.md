This is Jasmine's Readme for the STAT 545 Assignment 3. 
A link to the instructions for this homework can be found [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw03/hw03.html).

Tasks Tackled:
- I chose to try making nice tables and plots for tasks 1-5.    
- Please consider tasks 1,2,4, and 5 for grading.     
- I showed my work for task 3, although I struggled with this task.   


Note: In this homework, I installed another library called **gridExtra** .    
To dowload this library, you will need to run install.packages("gridExtra") in the console. 

You can find the md file [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT545_hw003_JLB.md)  

You can find the Rmd file [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-JasmineLib/blob/master/STAT545_hw003_JLB.Rmd)

You can find the files containing graph outputs [here](https://github.com/STAT545-UBC-students/hw03-JasmineLib/tree/master/STAT545_hw003_JLB_files/figure-markdown_github), where the Task# is noted in the name of each graph for your reference and convenience. 


Something I struggled with: 
- Changing the size of the plots I was working with as they displayed. I tried using the height and width functions to adjust these, as well as adding margins in one case. I would love some tips on how to better display the graphs! 
- Task 3

Thanks.
