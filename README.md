This is Jasmine's Readme for the STAT 545 Assignment 3. 
A link to the instructions for this homework can be found [here](http://stat545.com/Classroom/assignments/hw03/hw03.html).

Tasks Tackled:
I chose to try making nice tables and plots for tasks 1-5:
Please consider tasks 1,2,4, and 5 for grading. 
I showed my work for task 3, although I struggled with this task. 


Note: In this homework, I installed another library called gridExtra.   
To dowload this library, you will need to run install.packages("gridExtra") in the console. 


Something I struggled with: Changing the size of the plots I was working with as they displayed. I tried using the height and width functions to adjust these, as well as adding margins in one case. I would love some tips on how to better display the graphs! Thanks.
